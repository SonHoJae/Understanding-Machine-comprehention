# Understanding-Machine-comprehention

In this repository, I would like to summarize couple papers to understand [Bi-directional Attention Flow for Machine Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01603).
## 1. Understanding Attention mechanism with [Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate_ 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473)
> Prior to this paper, neural machine translation(nmt) has been focused with statistical machine translation(smt). this paper proposed a building nmt without phase to phase segmentation or toknization. Additionally, it resolved issue that Encoder-Decoder Model has fixed-length vector
